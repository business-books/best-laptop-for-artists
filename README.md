# Best laptop for artists
What is the <a href="https://qualified.one/blog/design/best-laptop-for-artists/">best laptop for artists</a> in 2022?

MSI GP60 (2PE-050X)
MSI GP60 (2PE-050X) cannot be called a gaming laptop, but compared to all those that were reviewed earlier in this review, this model is simply the king and god of games, while its cost is only 26 thousand rubles. If you set a goal and search, then on the market you can find even cheaper laptops with an NVIDIA GeForce 840 video card - from ASUS, for example. But the MSI GP60 (2PE-050X) has a more powerful processor, which will allow the graphics card to reach its full potential.

However, this is where the differences between the MSI GP60 (2PE-050X) and inexpensive laptops end. Its 15.6-inch screen supports resolutions up to 1366x768 pixels, only 4 GB of RAM (normal for an inexpensive laptop, but not solid for a gaming laptop), the drive is a regular 500 GB hard drive, no SSD. Still, the MSI GP60 has an excellent price/performance ratio.

## Lenovo IdeaPad Z510 best laptop for artist
The next laptop, despite a slightly higher price, cannot boast of equally powerful graphics: the Lenovo IdeaPad Z510 has a slightly simpler NVIDIA GeForce 740M. However, this laptop has a terabyte hard drive, and a hybrid one with an 8 GB SSD. That is, you get a lot of space for your files, and it doesn’t slow down as much as on a laptop with a regular hard drive.

The Lenovo IdeaPad Z510 also boasts a Full HD display and 6 GB of RAM. It’s not that 2 extra gigabytes greatly add speed to the laptop, but still, some programs will feel freer, which means they will be less annoying with slowdowns. All in all, the Z510 is a good inexpensive desktop replacement. Even though it is not a gaming one to the extent that most students would like, it is perfect for studying and will not become outdated in a year, besides, you can always watch a movie on a good display.

## Lenovo IdeaPad Y510p best laptop for artists
The laptop from Lenovo is famous for the fact that instead of an optical drive, you can put in it an additional drive or even a second discrete graphics card. By default, there is one NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M and it is generally not bad for games, although with a screen resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, games will show low FPS if set to more than average settings. However, the laptop is perfectly balanced and has an attractive appearance and aggressively red backlit keys.

Another of the positive qualities can be noted a capacious hard drive per terabyte with an SSD cache of 8 GB. Lenovo IdeaPad Y510p also boasts a fairly productive dual-core Intel Core i5-4200M processor. However, it consumes energy exactly like its quad-core counterpart i7-4702MQ, and is significantly inferior in performance. Overall, the Lenovo IdeaPad Y510p is a good value for the money, especially if you add another 4 GB of RAM to it.

## HP ENVY TouchSmart 15-j151sr best laptop for artists
And finally, the most interesting and, accordingly, the most expensive copy. In the HP ENVY TouchSmart 15-j151sr, which costs $600, you can find a good screen, a powerful processor, a good video card, and even an SSD at the same time. But first things first.

The laptop display is displayed at 1920x1080 pixels, the diagonal is 15.6 inches - the most suitable option for the home, but with the ability to take a laptop with you if necessary. Its mass is only 2.56 kg. The Intel Core i7-4702MQ processor boasts an excellent performance-per-watt ratio, which makes it popular in thin gaming laptops. It is complemented by 8 GB of RAM and an "almost" gaming video card - NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M. Finally, the terabyte hard drive is "accelerated" with a 24 GB SSD.
